                <p>Prompted by the theme "Pandemic Media", we wanted to focus on the space of your own home.
                    A <a href="https://toolkits.dss.cloud/design/method-card/photo-safari/">photo safari</a> was done
                    to gain insights on the changes of one's home. Results showed that as things moved towards
                    being carried out remotely, the home became a multispace. It was not only a place for sleep, food,
                    and relaxation, it also acted as an office and a gym.
                </p>
                <p>In a situation where the line separating free and working time is becoming increasingly
                    blurred, it is important to find those micro-opportunities for relaxation and self-care.
                    We found that the natural breaks one takes during meals could be used for this purpose.
                </p>

                <p>My main contributions to this project was 3D modelling the coaster base, and programming the LED-lights.
                    The coaster base was modelled using SolidWorks, and the LED-lights were programmed using an Arduino UNO
                    and Neopixels.

                <p>The final prototype was well recieved, with comments such as "It helps me feel better when I take a deep breath"
                    and "Even just looking at the video of the prototype calmed me down. I breathed with the light without even thinking much about it.
                    The interaction was really inviting".
