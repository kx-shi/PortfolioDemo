                <p>Datatonism is a digital emulation of the Dataton System 3000 – a modular synthesizer designed by Björn Sandlund in the 1970's.
                    The project was an interesting insight about the fundamental differences between digital and analog systems.
                    Apart from that, it was also a great exercise in learning more digital signal processing.

                <p>The final presentation was held at Scenkonstmuseet and the project itself served as a basis for the paper
                    "Datatonism: Historically Informed Sound Synthesis As A Pedagogic Exercise" which was accepted and presented at the Nordic SMC 2021.

                <p>The result is a open-source software that one can download and play around with.</p>
